## Why Microsoft Teams does not work for Students??

**
This is mainly post for admins who take care of IT at schools.

If you happen to be setting up a tenant for a school you my face a problem with Teams, meaning that Teams works for teachers, but not for students.

The thing is that Teams for students has to be additionally enabled in Office 365 Admin portal because by default it's disabled.

Below you can find the steps how to enable it:

 1. Go to portal.office.com 
 2. From list of apps choose Admin
 3. Right top corner, blue switch, turn off new Admin portal
 4. Left panel - Settings
 5. Go to Services & Add-ins
 6. Find Microsoft Teams
 7. Find Settings by user/license type
 8. Switch Teams on for Students

After those steps, it may take up to 24h to come into effect.
